                <div class="gallery-text">
                    <p>I made this blushing art piece after a year spent squeezing out small-scale sketches
                        in stolen moments. During my first job out of college, a 9-to-5 corporate desk job, I made
                        hundreds of like drawings on sticky notes, notebook pages, PDF editors... no surface
                        susceptible to mark-making was spared. I felt out of place much of the time, but this drawing
                        habit became my companion.</p> 
                        <p>"Would you be my evening companion?" is a question we might ask
                        of others, of an activity, a practice, a substance, or perhaps of ourselves. The day is often spent in service to the world outside of
                        our personal desires in work, volunteerism, or managing the practical problems that seem to
                        accumulate without end. I ask, and am asked, to conspire in the evening time, when personal fulfillment seems nearer
                        within reach.</p>

                    <p>This is the first sketch I made in the style. I stumbled into this technique one weekend morning, and it
                        pleased me greatly. I found it gratifying and beautiful. I kept drawing, and drawing,
                        and drawing...</p>
